    I began to take an interest in front-end web and mobile development
    in early 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that, I did quite a lot of proofreading and book layout,
    alongside some other jobs, mostly ones that required
    accuracy and attention to detail --
    which are among my strongest suits.

    These days I develop hybrid apps for Android using Bootstrap, jQuery
    and Angular 2.
