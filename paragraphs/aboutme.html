    I began to take an interest in front-end web and mobile development
    in early 2016.

    Before that, I did a lot of book layout (which is slightly similar, only
    much simpler) and other jobs, mostly ones that required a great deal of
    accuracy and attention to detail,
    which are among my strongest suits.

    These days I develop hybrid Android apps in Bootstrap, jQuery
    and Angular 2.
