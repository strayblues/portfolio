  <p>With over 150 applicants and only about 30 spots, I was pretty lucky
     to be among the participants of this incredibly fun workshop
     that took place on May 2016 in Campus TLV.</p>
  <p>This one day workshop dedicated to building a django powered blog,
    which was eventually deployed on pythonanywhere.com.
    My app is no longer hosted there, but the code can be found
    on my GitHub account.</p>
  <p>Participating the workshop had also won me a ticket to PyConIL2016.</p>
